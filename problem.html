			<h1>The Problem</h1>
			<p>
				Everything technological that is too time consuming is a problem from a technological perspective.<br>
				Especially if we could get the work done in minutes. Lets look at these kinds of problems. But first, let<br>
				us ask you some questions. Are you aware of all the services that are connected to your email address?<br>
				Have you always had the same email address ever since you created one? You would probably answer<br>
				â€œnoâ€ to at least one of the questions above. Then you would probably have experienced problems with<br>
				unwanted emails or problems with changing to new email address without knowing the important<br>
				services that has your old email address. Let's look at what people say about this<br>
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Our Research</h2>
			<p>	We made a survey consisting of six questions. The survey was conducted in november 2016 among 100<br>
				email users from different age groups all around the world. The users were informed about that this<br>
				survey is only being used to this final project. We will use the results of the survey to show the<br>
			</p>
			<img src="1.png" alt="diagram1" title="How old are you?"> 
			<p>
				Here we can see that 6% of the users were from age 12-18, 38% of user were from age 19-40,<br>
				39% of the users were from age 41-55 and 6% from age 56+.<br>
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src="2.png" alt="diagram2" title="How many e-mails have you had?">
			<p>
				This diagram shows that over 90% of the people didnt't have the same email address ever since<br>
				they created one.<br>
			</p>
			<img src="3.png" alt="diagram3" title="Are you aware of all the services that are connected to your email address">
			<p>
				This diagram shows that over 90% of the people aren't aware of all the services connected to their<br>
				email address.<br>
			</p>
			<img src="4.png" alt="diagram4" title="Do you think it is a big problem that your e-mail is registered places you don't remember?">
			<p>
				This diagram shows that over 70% of the people think that their unawareness of the places their email<br>
				is registered to is a big problem.<br>
			</p>
			<img src="6.png" alt="diagram6" title="How do you handle unwanted emails/spam">
			<p>
				his diagram shows that over 70% of the users would have used the application we will be describing as<br>
				our solution for the problems we will be adressing now.<br>
			</p>
			<img src="5.png" alt="diagram5" title="Would you use an application that gives you: -an overview of all the services connected with your email - the choice of removing your email - the choice of removing your email from an unnecessary service - the choice of not getting any emails from the service?">
			<p>
				This diagram shows how our users handle unwanted emails. The majority of the users delete it, ignore<br>
				it or try to unsubscribe from the sender.<br>
			</p>
			<h2>The First Problem</h2>
			<p>
				The first problem: Unwanted emails. How do you handle unwanted emails? You can try to manually go<br>
				and unsubscribe from every sender of the unwanted emails, delete every time you get an unwanted<br>
				email, ignore every time you get an unwanted email, set up filters or report the unwanted email as<br>
				spam. Letâ€™s look at how our email users handle this problem.<br>
			</p>
			<img src="6.png" alt="diagram6" title="How do you handle unwanted emails/spam?">
			<p>
				 These methods to prevent unwanted emails are too time consuming or annoying. From a technological<br>
                 perspective, this is a problem. How can we possibly prevent this time consuming work with unwanted<br>
                 emails? The answer is “e-Tracker”. We will tell you about it later. But first, let us address the second<br>
                 problem.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Second Problem</h2>
            <p>
            	The first time you created an email address, you probably wouldnâ€™t have thought of using it for<br>
				professional inquiries. So, your first email address would have been something like sexyboy97@live.no,<br>
				barbie23@gmail.com, kittygirl@yahoo.com or kingofoslo@hotmail.com. And now you want your email<br>
				address to be more professional. So, you create a new email address. Or you just have another good<br>
				reason to change your email address, so you create a new one. Here you can see how many of our<br>
				email users that have changed their email addresses. Which is over 90% as said earlier.<br>
			</p>
			<img src="2.png" alt="diagram2" title="How many e-mails have you had?">
			<p>
				But you have your previous email address registered to so many services that you donâ€™t have any<br>
				overview over the important ones. So, you must manually go and find the important services and send<br>
				an email about your new email address. This is also time consuming which is also a problem from a<br>
				technological perspective. And as said over 70% of our survey answerers think this is a big problem too.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				How can we possibly prevent this time-consuming work forever? The answer for this one is e-Tracker<br>
				too. What is this e-Tracker? The e-Tracker is a web-based application and our solution for the<br>
				problems we adressed. You can read about our solution by clicking "Solution" in the navigation bar or<br>
